# Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Typescript Basics

<details><summary>Typescript Configuration & Compilation</summary>
<h3>How is Typescript setup?</h3>

Typescript is typically setup by running the following command:

```bash
tsc --init
```

This command will create a [`tsconfig.json`](https://github.com/excircle/learning-typescript/blob/main/tsconfig.json) which will hold your compilation config and apply them at runtime, saving you from having to provide the options manually (<i>as would be the case if executing from the command line</i>).
